                <h2 class="home-h2">About cookies</h2>
                <p>You may have heard of internet cookies...you may know all about them. To confirm, cookies are small
                    text files that are placed on your computer by websites you visit.</p>
                <p>Cookies allow us to identify you (or, more accurately, your computer) when you visit our website.
                    Knowing how often people are visiting each page of our website helps us work out how and where to
                    improve our website.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>By continuing to use our website, you consent to the use of cookies (including third-party
                        cookies) as described in this policy. This cookie policy is part of our </strong>

                <h2 class="home-h2">Types of cookie</h2>
                <h3>Categories</h3>
                <p><strong>Necessary</strong> cookies help make our website usable by enabling basic functions like page
                    navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without
                    these cookies.</p>
                <p><strong>Performance </strong>cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our websites by
                    collecting and reporting information anonymously.</p>
                <p><strong>Marketing</strong> cookies are used to track visitors across websites. The intention is to
                    display content and ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more
                    valuable.</p>
                <h3>Persistent cookies and session cookies</h3>
                <p><strong>Persistent</strong> cookies remain on a visitor&rsquo;s device for a set amount of time. This
                    means for example that we can identify when a site visitor is a repeat visitor or new to us.</p>
                <p><strong>Session</strong> cookies are created temporarily and last for as long as your browser window
                    is open, being automatically deleted after you close your browser. These allow us to link the
                    actions of a user during a visit to the website, to provide a consistent experience.</p>

                <h2 class="home-h2">The cookies we use</h2>
                <p>Details about the cookies we use are set out in the table below. Some of these are third party
                    cookies - see the section on third party cookies below for more information.</p>

                            <p>The PHPSESSID cookie is native to PHP and enables websites to store serialised state
                                data. On the Action website it is used to establish a user session and to pass state
                                data via a temporary cookie, which is commonly referred to as a session cookie. As the
                                PHPSESSID cookie has no timed expiry, it disappears when the session is closed.</p>

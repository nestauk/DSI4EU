                <p>
                    The past few years have seen a rapid growth in the number of people using digital technologies to
                    tackle social challenges in areas ranging from healthcare and education to democracy and the
                    environment. This phenomenon, which we call <a href="http://digitalsocial.eu/">digital social
                        innovation</a> (DSI), aims to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reorient technology to social ends, and to harness it to improve lives and benefit the many
                        rather than the few;
                    <li>empower citizens to take more control over their lives, and to use their collective knowledge
                        and skills to positive effect;
                    <li>make government more accountable and transparent;
                    <li>foster and promote alternatives to the dominant technological and business models — alternatives
                        which are open and collaborative rather than closed and competitive;
                    <li>use technology to create a more environmentally sustainable society.
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite the many inspiring initiatives taking place across Europe and the world, relatively few have
                    grown to deliver positive social impact at scale, for a range of reasons which we and others
                    <a href="http://bit.ly/DSINext">have explored in depth</a>.

                <p>
                    The latest phase of DSI4EU, running from January 2018 to June 2019, is being carried out by a
                    consortium of seven partner organisations: Nesta (UK), Waag (Netherlands), betterplace lab
                    (Germany), Fab Lab Barcelona (Spain), WeMake (Italy), Barcelona Activa (Spain) and the ePaństwo
                    Foundation (Poland). Find out more about the partners <a href="http://digitalsocial.eu/partners">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next year and a half, we will be carrying out a range of activities to support DSI in
                    Europe.

                <h2>The digitalsocial.eu platform</h2>
                <p>
                    At the heart of the project is the digitalsocial.eu platform, a lively hub for DSI through which
                    users can:
                </p>
                <ul>

                <h2>DSI clusters</h2>
                <p>
                    Alongside the digitalsocial.eu platform, partner organisations are coordinating six thematic DSI
                    clusters. Within each cluster, we are organising a programme of events, learning and networking
                    opportunities and engaging with policymakers to advocate for committed and effective DSI support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clusters are based around the following social areas:

                    Knowledge sharing and new connections

                <p>
                    With seven partners in six countries and several years’ experience working on DSI, we aim to be a
                    knowledge hub for DSI in Europe. A key part of our role, therefore, is to be a point of contact for
                    anyone who wants to know more about DSI — connecting you to new people, directing you to relevant
                    research and resources, and running events to share knowledge and facilitate networking
                    opportunities.

                <h2>Policy and research</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that influencing policy at different levels is essential to supporting DSI to grow and
                    scale its impact. Therefore, over the course of the project we are engaging with policymakers and
                    key influencers at the European, national and city levels to shape the future of DSI. Furthermore,
                    we are developing an experimental index of how policymakers are supporting DSI across Europe, which
                    aims to highlight best practice and spur collaboration between countries and cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we are carrying out exciting research into emerging technologies like blockchain and
                    artificial intelligence and assessing what they mean for DSI. We are analysing emerging trends and
                    building different future scenarios for DSI, with the aim to help shape a more positive future which
                    harnesses technology for positive social impact.

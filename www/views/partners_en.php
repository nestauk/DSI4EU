                <p>DSI4EU is a coordination and support action funded under the European Commission&rsquo;s Collective
                    Awareness Platforms for Sustainability (CAPS) programme. The CAPS programme supports DSI in Europe
                    through funding for projects, coordination, support, events and networking. </p>
                <p>CAPS projects are designing and piloting online platforms creating awareness of sustainability
                    problems and offering collaborative solutions based on innovative networks of people, ideas,
                    services and technologies enabling new forms of social innovation. The CAPS programme supports
                    environment-aware efforts, grassroots processes and practices to share knowledge, achieve changes in
                    lifestyle, production and consumption patterns, and set up more participatory democratic processes
                    on a pan-European scale.</p>
                <p>As part of the CAPS community, we are particularly proud to be supporting the projects developing DSI
                    solutions with funding from the European Commission. We also work closely with the <a
                            href="http://capssi.eu">ChiC project</a>, which aims to empower the community of CAPS
                    projects and promote their outcomes and results. </p>
                <h2>Social Innovation Community </h2>
                <p>DSI4EU works closely with <a href="http://siceurope.eu">Social Innovation Community</a> (SIC), a
                    Horizon 2020-funded project which seeks to strengthen, connect and grow existing social innovation
                    communities across Europe. Social Innovation Community is based around specific networks, one of
                    which is DSI. By fostering close links between the two projects, we are able to introduce DSI actors
                    to other social innovation actors, and vice versa. Please <a href="mailto:contact@digitalsocial.eu">get
